Sergio López Baños is a Researcher at [Deutschland für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/de). He earned his MSc in quantum computing at Nebrija University and a BSc in physics at the University of Murcia. After the MSc, he got a part time researcher position at DLR at the Networked Energy Systems group. Nowadays, he is looking for a PhD position at DLR that allows him to pursue his academic career to the next level. The PhD focus on the application of quantum computing to different problems in the energy sector.



Research Topics
======
**Main Research Topic: Quantum Operation Research** <br>
Nowadays, I consider myself an Optimization Engineer with a focus on operation research topics in quantum computing. My ongoing research explores the possibilities of combining classical solvers with quantum solvers to solve a set of suitable optimization problems.

**Secondary Research Topics: Convolutional Neural Networks**<br>
Part of my work at DLR consists on the implementation of a convolutional neural network to detect a set of items in an electrical substation. <br>
I have also worked with **Planet Python API** to get the data from a set of filtered queries.
